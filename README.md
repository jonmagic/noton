# Noton

*/ nōˌtän /*

This application is all about taking notes and then using what you've written. From journal entries, to emails, to lists, Noton makes writing and using your notes simple and fast.

Navigate your notes like you surf the web. The search bar at the top is universal search for your notes and the search results are displayed instantly with each key press.

Create rich notes with Markdown and take things a step further with GitHub Flavored Markdown and features like Task Lists. View your rendered note in realtime as you type or toggle between edit and view modes.

Selectively publish notes as public Gists or publish every note as a private Gist.

Noton was inspired by [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net) and is built on [atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell).
